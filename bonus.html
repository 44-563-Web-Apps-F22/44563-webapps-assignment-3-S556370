            <h3> <i>MASCOT - Stanford tree of Stanford University.</i></h3>

            <p>
                The central part of the seal is occupied by the so-called Stanford tree. One of the reasons for
                choosing this symbol was
                that trees, especially coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is a representative of El Palo Alto and
                logo of the city of
                Palo Alto. Since Stanford University and Palo Alto are almost inextricably intertwined in interests
                and location, it is
                a natural outgrowth of this relationship.

            <h2>Three facts about Stanford University</h2>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>1. Leland Stanford, Governor and United States Senator of California and leading railroad tycoon,
                    and his wife founded the university in 1885 in memory of their son, Leland Stanford, Jr., who died
                    of typhoid at the age of 15. Within weeks of his death, the Stanford decided that, because they no
                    longer could do anything for their own child, “the children of California shall be our children.”
                    Thus, Stanford University was established as a coeducational and non-denominational institution
                    imparting free-of-cost education – till the mid-1930s.</li>
                <li> The motto of Stanford University is “Die Luft der Freiheit weht.” Translated from the German
                    language, this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means, “The wind of freedom blows.”
                </li>
                <li> It is Established in 1885, with classes starting in 1891, the university is spread across a
                    sprawling 8,100acre campus. It has seven schools imparting courses in humanities, sciences,
                    business, education, engineering, law, and medicine. It has an annual enrolment of over 18,623
                    students.</li>
